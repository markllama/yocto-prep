# yocto-prep
Playbooks to build and prepare a Yocto build machine and to build a demo image for Raspberry Pi

These are based at least initially on the [Udemy](https://udemy.com) course [Yocto: Zero to Hero - Building Embedded Linux](https://www.udemy.com/course/yocto-zero-to-hero) by [ECLabs](https://www.udemy.com/user/eclabs/).
